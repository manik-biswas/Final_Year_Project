            <p id="text">Department of Engineering &amp; Technological Studies (Formerly University Science Instrumentation
                Centre or USIC) was established in the year 1978 by the University Grants Commission (UGC).<br> With an
                aim at promoting the Centre and to diversify its activity, the UGC subsequently upgraded it to Level-III,
                the highest level of an USIC, during its 8th plan period. <br>USIC of University of Kalyani was the only USIC in
                the Eastern region of the country, which had been upgraded to Level-III by the UGC.<br> As a condition of
                upgradation, a One-year (Two semesters) Post-Graduate Diploma in Instrumentation (PGDI) course was
                started from the 1992-1993 academic session. <br>The course was aimed at imparting a job-oriented
                training programme to Honours Graduates in Physical Sciences. <br>Later to enhance the utility of the
                course the University upgraded the course to Two-years&#39; (Four semesters) Post-Graduate Diploma in
                Instrumentation, so that the students can do better in the job market<br>
                As per the advice and the approval given by the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) in 1999,
                University of Kalyani introduced Two 4-year B. Tech courses in—<br> (i) Electronics and Instrumentation
                Engineering and <br>(ii) Information Technology at USIC from the academic session 1999-2000 with the
                intake from WBJEE. <br>In 2005 USIC obtained the approval of AICTE for M. Tech. course in Communication
                Engineering, though the course started in 2010-2011 academic session. <br>The Ph.D. curricula in several
                field of Engineering were also started at USIC from the same academic session, as per UGC guideline. <br>In
                2022 the department obtained the approval of AICTE to start a 4-year B. Tech course in Electronics and
                Communication Engineering and a 2-year M. Tech. course in Information Technology.
